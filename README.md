# misc-scripts
A collection of random scripts I've written that are probably of use to no one but me

## critrole.py
I watch Critical Role but since timezones are not in my favour and I don't really like twitch overall and much prefer to watch them on my local machine via plex or similar. I wrote a script to automatically download episodes after they air and strip out some of the stuff I don't want in the name etc. Script is run via cron. Needs cookies.txt due to a bug in youtube-dl with auth and twitch getting redirects, haven't tested in a month or so to see if it's still an issue.
